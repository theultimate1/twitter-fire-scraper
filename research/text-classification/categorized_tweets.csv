First of all being the real and historic neighbor of #Afghanistan we the people from #OccupiedBalochistan condemn Pakistan's terror attack on innocent women, children and people in the month of holly #Ramadan in strongest possible terms. 
We extend our sincere and deepest condolences to the brave people of #Afghanistan who have equally victims of Pakistani terrorism. We feel the pain equally because #Balochistan and #Afghanistan are two eyes of one body. 
We are very sad that still people in #Afghan government lending friendship hand towards #ISI which never forgive its own people. How they will forgive #Afghanistan? 
Two days before all the Scholars of Panjab #Lahore #Islamabad unanimously issued a #Fatwa terming the #Jihad,  #SuicideBombings as #Harram but today when they themselves conducting #SuicideBombing in #Kabul in the month of #RAMADAN none of these Panjabi Mullahs and #Muftis utter a single world against such inhuman acts by #ISI. 
Afghanistan government thinks if it helps to liberate #Balochistan and #Pashtunistna people #Pakistan #ISI will be unhappy?

Well for decades #ISI is killing your innocent women, children and countrymen if you support to #Liberate #Balochistan #Pashtunistan believe me the genocide of #BalochAfghan will stop forever. 
Bangladesh sacrificed 3 million #Bangali and today they are an independent State in 1971.

If Afghanistan could supported #FreeBalochistan movement during 1980 today there were no bomb blasts, suicide bombing on Afghan women and children because #NoPaksitanNoProblem.

#Afghanistan must come with courage to support #FreeBalochPashtunState to stop Pakistani terrorism forever. Isn't better to die once than everyday?

63,fire,"My heart aches for all the people affected by the nation's fires this season - both close to home and far away. The harrowing stories of the first responders and volunteers who put their lives in danger to save lives and homes are truly inspiring. And the stories from the victims gives me goosebumps (6 hours in a bone chilling pool to survive while everything around you melts?! Really?! And Izzy??? üò≠).
//
On a personal note, it's been saddening to see many places I have found solace in over the years go up in flames. It wasn't until this last weekend that we smelled what typically is a happy campfire scent along our hike that it became real. After we got back to the trailhead under the aid of our headlamps and started the journey home in the dark, we saw miles of hillside lit up in flames along this FS road. While this one is ""contained"" it is truly eery to see entire hillsides ablaze, trees burning and the ground smoldering. //

101,fire,"‚ÄúGod is our refuge and strength, always ready to help in times of trouble. So we will not fear when earthquakes come and the mountains crumble into the sea. Let the oceans roar and foam. Let the mountains tremble as the waters surge! A river brings joy to the city of our God, the sacred home of the Most High. God dwells in that city; it cannot be destroyed. From the very break of day, God will protect it. The nations are in chaos, and their kingdoms crumble! God‚Äôs voice thunders, and the earth melts! The Lord of Heaven‚Äôs Armies is here among us; the God of Israel is our fortress. Come, see the glorious works of the Lord: See how he brings destruction upon the world. He causes wars to end throughout the earth. He breaks the bow and snaps the spear; he burns the shields with fire. ‚ÄúBe still, and know that I am God! I will be honored by every nation.

Even for a wordy SOB like me, it's hard to explain what we've been through the last 48 hours. We should've known camping next to a rusty torpedo that was attached to a dead tree like a gargoyle to an old church would be a sign of treachery to come. Still, we have managed to endure the smoke and flames of forrest fires, both figurative and literal, and we've rendezvoused with our crew in Anchorage along with our hot air balloon pilot, Mike. 
Tonight at 10:30 pm, we take flight.

Throwback from 2010, I remember sleeping in bed in these same apartments when all of a sudden my mom wakes me up at 2:00 a.m. and said, an apartment is on fire! I ran outside on the balcony to see all of building E burning. Everybody including the neighbors came out: Dallas firefighters from different stations, news, even the Red Cross. I ran to building D across the parking lot to watch upclose as the top two floors of the building collapsed. It was scary and the next day came. When I left for school, it was just the first floor remained but when I came home, it was nothing but a big pile of rubble surrounded by a fence for safety. I remember on the news that residents on the 3rd floor jumped to evacuate the building.

Safety was also a major concern Industrial work was very unsafe particularly the rail roads. Before the invention of the air brake trains employed men known as brakemen who job was ride on the top of the train and unscrew a mechanical wheel that unlocked braked by hand. It was a risky job because we‚Äôre shaken off the trains by rough tracks, steep bends and bridges. There are a number of accounts of men being crushed to death or horrifically scolded by steam from boilers. Carnegie Steel plant was home to one of the highest rates of industrial workplace injuries with an estimated 20% of employees being injured or killed between 1907 and 1910. The worst was perhaps in 1911 at the Triangle Shirt Factory in New York City where all 147 employees died in a fire. There were no proper fire escape and exits that could have been used were locked.

123,fire,"Glowing tin on the side of a garden shed at a fire we fought earlier this year. Fires with significant fuel loads output a lot of heat energy, and develop very quickly. Temperatures in this garden shed alone were upwards of 500 degrees Celsius when we first arrived, fuelled by an adjoining building, packed with numerous types of fuels and chemicals. Our first priority is always to protect exposures, and to work our way from the area of least damage, so as to prevent further fire spread and subsequent damage. Concentrating on the area that's burning the most isn't always the smartest way to tackle a decent sized fire.

The Borno State Commissioner of Police, Damien Chukwu, confirmed the attack to newsmen at a press briefing on Monday, and said that a male suicide bomber gained entry into the premises of the University of Maiduguri, and detonated a bomb (PBIED), strapped to his body, near the Rapid Response Services Office building.

According to him, the suicide bomber died while three of the university‚Äôs security personnel on duty were injured.

It was gathered that one of the injured security personnel, a female, whose identity was given as Becky Edubi, later died while being attended to at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital. | #borno #unimaid #maiduguri #nigeria  #terrorattack | Read more : www.theguildng.com"

I don‚Äôt know what I would do if my whole house, garden, charity gardens and all sentimental value is gone for good. Yeah that‚Äôs painful and don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs a loss of bud but we can always grow. @subcool420 as well as countless others are all in need of some good cannabis community support. Will try to find links to donate or something, anything. I say we show support, regardless of all of the differences we have with each other I know one thing, the community works really well when we put aside our differences and we look at one another as an equal.

Yemen is one of the world's poorest and least developed nations. Traditionally neglected, almost half the country's residents are malnourished and have no access to clean water. Since March 19th hundreds of people have been killed and injured, including children. Hospitals are struggling to cope, shops have closed, water and electricity supplies have been cut off, tens of thousands of people have fled their homes, and much higher levels of displacement are anticipated. The humanitarian situation is heading for catastrophe. An estimated 15 million people - almost two-thirds of the population - need humanitarian assistance. The humanitarian situation is heading for catastrophe. Women and children in Yemen today are displaced and hungry. It is our duty to come to their aid and support them with that which Allah has granted us. Donate whatever you can for the sake of Allah.

That turned into something I could not only hear but now visualize. I've already made my donation and plan on doing all that can to help.

We were homeless for 5 months, & I learned some of the most important lessons of my life in that time. Here's a few:
- Humanity isn't completely lost. We had nothing, but friends and strangers came together and offered whatever they could to help. (PLEASE give to an organization you trust to help Puerto Rico and the other islands affected by Hurricanes this summer) - With everyone in my neighborhood filled with loss, and depression, I learned how important my gift to produce smiles and laughter is. - Uncertainty is scary,  struggle is discouraging, but it gets better if you appreciate each new day & have the faith & Courage to keep moving forward towards your goals. 
5 years later,  I'm the best version of myself that I've been thus far! Good health,  Good job,  GOOD HAIR üòé LOL,  still performing, & so much food in the fridge I write songs about it! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I've always believed we help others through sharing our personal experiences.

189,flood,"Natural Disaster Update: A tropical depression and flooding has left 54 dead and 39 missing in Vietnam. 
A former construction professor at the University of Hanoi stated that if accurate rain volume had been forecasted, reservoirs would have released water earlier and more slowly, reducing the risk of floods in the lowlands. The poor forecast resulted in sudden water release which surprised residents. As a consequence, they did not have time to evacuate."

A real estate expert, Emmanuel Gyane, has attributed Accra‚Äôs perennial floods mainly to a lack of monitoring systems in the city.Emmanuel Gyane, Chief Executive Officer of real estate company Altheo Ventures and Construction Limited, said that Accra‚Äôs perennial floods could be mitigated if city officials would impose measures to prevent the construction of buildings on waterways.Mr. Gyane explained that constructing a building on a waterway blocks the free flow of water bodies and, as a result, causes floods when it rains. He advocated the introduction of measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

I watched the rain from my window over the course of an hour, the sewers and gutters on the sides of the street were stuffed due to a build up of trash. The water couldn't flow, and as a result the water and trash began to flow out into the street- forming a new river. Lots of people came out to watch, myself included. Last year, well over 150 people died in the flood because a Total gas station blew up. Because of last years tragic accidents, people were telling me that this wasnt as bad. I have never seen any flooding like this before, so I was in awe. Everyone else seemed rather calm, cars and motorcycles still drove over this bridge and everything!

The Atlantic Ocean broke right through the Beach/streets and merged with the bay. (See pix). The flooding was simply unimaginable.

Local officials said the tolls would rise as search and rescue teams reached remote areas. More than 70,000 people were in need of emergency shelter, the Iranian Red Crescent said. The hardest hit province was #Kermanshah, where three days of mourning have been announced. More than 236 people died in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab, about 10 miles from the Iraq border.

It has been a long night of struggle for people here in Dr. Zakir Hussain Busty (Butcher busty). As the time passes by, the hopes of finding those missing alive fades.

The army and disaster management teams are doing their best to find those missing, but they are yet to make significant progress since the last successful rescue of Allauddin.

Four original residents and speculated two more guests are still missing.

The GTA Chief arrived early today, and has monitored the rescue efforts, tension evident in his face, reflective of the tension that entire Darjeeling feels today.

Please do PRAY that those missing may be found soon. [Sriju Bal Tamang for TheDC]"

Some situations in life are simply depressing and difficult, times such as these leave you helpless and in silence. Hurricane Maria slammed the Island of Dominica, West Indies causing several immediate deaths with the death toll rising and people missing. The residents of Dominica are currently suffering from its aftermath with no food, shelter, and many difficulties. All we can do is console their loss and support them emotionally and financially. .
This magnanimous Category 5 Storm destroyed my beautiful Campus along with many other places close to my heart where I had been attending medical school for approximately 2 years happily. Ross University School of Medicine is completely destroyed, gratefully there are no student, staff, and faculty casualties. #dominicastrong #dominicastrongüá©üá≤ #dominica .

40,damaged_infrastructure,"Hurricane Sandy. I can't believe it has been 5 years!! The damage to NJ was horrible, but the damage to my childhood town Tottenville, Staten Island was devastating. üíî I volunteered every weekend. I slept in my freezing car friday & sat nights. I met some amazing people volunteering. üíô The first picture is of Rockaway St, the bottom right house was the first house I lived in. They only had flooding. The yellow restaurant next to it was the Rockaway Cove, it was the closest to the beach, where I would always drink Shirley Temples. The top house became a nationwide known picture during Sandy. Their granddaughter Cindy was in my grade & their 2 sons Phil & Tony were good friends of my dad.  Yetman Ave was the next block. My cousins Craig & Mark used to live by the house that was swept away where the 14 y/o Angela & her father were killed. The picture of their stairs was all that was left. The house on Yetman which became the volunteer house, was where 2 girls I worshiped growing up lived & my cousin Billy ended up marrying Sue. It was amazing seeing people dropping off goods, local donations & people drove from all over the country. People would drop off pictures & things they found. The one picture is a girl I went to elementary & middle school with. That gave me chills. Someone gave us tulips & they lasted months. A few months later I volunteered with Starbucks at the other end of the Island.

69,damaged_infrastructure,"@Regrann from @karriem_muhammad -  #DisasterPreparedness: #Christ warns us that a Major #Earthquake will soon Destroy Many Cities in America.

So we Must Prepare. We must store some food and water in our homes. 2-3 weeks to 2-3 months worth. And ways to cook and clean. First aid supplies.

Why?

Because after this Major Earthquake nearly every street, nearly every road, highway, will be destroyed.

No food coming in or out. No HELP coming to us. 
And all that we have in our homes is all that we will have. What if it takes three weeks to get the road fixed to get food into your city. Could you survive for three weeks with what you currently have in your home? 
How much water do you have stored? After this earthquake we won't be able to just turn on the water. There will be no water coming out because all the pipes, all the water mains will be destroyed. 
To learn how to prepare. To learn how much food and water we need, how to store it, and the best foods to store, send me an email at writermdm@gmail.com and I'll send you an disaster preparedness manual. - #regrann"

108,damaged_infrastructure,"(#CNN) At least 452 people were #killed and thousands #injured after a powerful #earthquake struck near the border of #Iran and #Iraq late Sunday. Earthquake is the #deadliest of the year, and was felt as far away as #Turkey and #Pakistan. Around 100 of the dead are believed to be from one town in Iran's #Kermanshah province, the country's semi-official Mehr news agency reported. Iran: 445 people confirmed dead, 7,100 injured, Iran's Press TV has reported Monday afternoon. Northern Iraq: 7 people dead in the semi-autonomous #Kurdish region, said Rekawt Hama Rasheed, the health minister of the Kurdish Regional Government. Iraq's health ministry added that 535 people were injured. The earthquake hit late Sunday night with the epicenter in a rural area on the Iranian side of the border, just south of the Iraqi city of #Halabja, according to the #US #Geological #Survey, which tracks earthquake activity around the world.  The quake was at a depth of 23 km (just over 14 miles), which is considered #shallow, according to the survey. It was felt across the region with aftershocks hitting Pakistan, #Lebanon, #Kuwait and Turkey, news agencies in those countries reported.

This one was the most intact and probably just got rolled down the hill, when the owner didn't want it anymore.

The other car wrecks looked more like they've just gotten thrown off a cliff and tumbled the way down here. You barely could recognize which model it was.

Well, I suppose that's how you got rid of your car in the 60‚Äôs. :D

MAF is working in support of our partner @samaritanspurse In the Caribbean so that those in need can be reached sooner and more efficiently.
.
Our aircraft can be airborne within hours of a disaster ‚Äì helping build a picture of the devastation and need from the air. MAF can assist in the aftermath ferrying essential supplies of tarpaulins, food, water and medical supplies and bringing in teams of workers to areas where roads and bridges have been washed away ‚Äì as they were in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew in October 2016.
.
Since 1945 MAF has enabled the work of churches, relief organisations, missionaries, medical teams, development agencies, and others working to share God‚Äôs love and make life better for those who live in the most isolated parts of the world. In recent years, MAF has responded to disasters in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew, in Nepal following two deadly earthquakes in 2015, and in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.

142,damaged_infrastructure,"Fast fashion is taking the lives of human beings and our appetites for cheap clothes are responsible. 
This picture says it all. Today we are throwing back to Bangladesh #2013 following the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory that killed over 1,100 people due to appalling working conditions, and irresponsible building standards. 
This is a stark reminder of why we need to slow our fashion down. We need to make a conscious choice to buy better quality items, less often. One that are ethically and environmentally conscious instead of trend-driven.

152,damaged_infrastructure,"To hear people, especially Christians, say that people in Iran and Iraq are receiving the consequences of their actions from the earthquake that has killed 320+ people and injured 5,000+ is disgusting and disappointing. EACH person is an image bearer of God, which means they have value. They are His children and Christ died for them, just as He died for you, no matter your gender, color of your skin, or religion. 
Praying fervently for those in Iran and Iraq who are injured, who are missing, those who have been traumatized, and the families who have lost loved ones. May the Prince of Peace pour out His shalom onto them.

We all knew eachother briefly on a first name orange painters tape name tag. The group I worked with we unloaded supplies and loaded trucks heading to other centers great guys. The last day we loaded semi truck. The forklift got stuck and I went to help push it out. Some of the new fresh volunteers had alot to say, saying we'd never push it out of the ditch, well me and Greg pushed it out and finished the job. There was a flood of new volunteers and we figured we'd disband and go our separate ways. I regret not taking a photo of them."

On #ThisDayinHistory 1989, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the San Francisco Bay Area. On that day, the Bay Area was buzzing about baseball. The Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants, both local teams, had reached the World Series. The third game of the series was scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. at San Francisco‚Äôs Candlestick Park. But, just prior to the game, a magnitude 6.9 quake rocked the San Francisco Bay region. Though the stadium withstood the shaking, other parts of the Bay Area were not as fortunate. Sixty-seven people were killed as a result of the 15-second quake, and more than 3,000 others were injured. Additionally more than $5 billion in damages were caused by the tectonic activity. In the quake‚Äôs aftermath, San Francisco and other communities enacted strict regulations requiring unreinforced masonry buildings to be retrofitted. #SanFrancisco #Earthquake #1989 #WorldSeries #quake #naturaldisaster"

It's been a year. Millions of tons of ruins nip in the bud any kind of reconstruction. Half a milion of italians are still forced to face destruction. Estimated damages of eight billion. Numbers. Behind the numbers there are people who resist, who do not give up, who are desperately trying to restart and to rebuild. They are left alone. Because the state government is not there. I had promised that I would not have forgotten and so I did. My thoughts have been with you every single day. Marchigiani. Abruzzesi. Umbri. I will always be with you.

274,damaged_infrastructure,"RepostBy @ummahyahseark: ""Greetings family,
as many people in the United States prepare this week to give thanks for everything that they've been blessed with, there are human beings in the Caribbean islands that are still devastated from hurricanes Irma and Maria. These people are our mothers, fathers, grandparents, sisters, brothers, children.. They have had no electricity, no cell phone service, no food to eat nor any clean water to drink, some for months now. They are in need of support and resources and are lacking both from the U.S., so the people are coming together to rebuild, renew and restore their homeland. If you are a part of the Rastafari community, or if you love reggae music, you may know that many wholesome artists (Midnite, Akae Beka, Dezarie, Zion I Kings) come from the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and are actively trying to rebuild their communities, while helping to sustain the life of the people every day by ways of basic needs (food, clean water, shelter).
My brother is traveling to Puerto Rico this week to help rebuild the community, and is bringing a suitcase of supplies to those in need. I am asking for donations to buy supplies such as LifeStraws (portable water filters), Flashlights, and any other necessities. 
I will pick someone from the list of contributers to recieve a gift for their help.. your choice of bracelets (men, women, and children styles and sizes) wire wrapped necklaces, and other customizable gifts. 
Thank you in advanced to anyone that is willing and able to donate to help out. Every 'whole' is made up of individual parts.. there are at least 7 billion human beings inhabiting the Earth right now, I am one of them and you are too. If one part of the world suffers then the whole world will suffer. We must do our part to help each other out in whatever way we are able to, for even the smallest of good deeds make a difference. 
Please contact me of you have any questions..
give thanks !

The tremor hit moments before the start of the game, and sportscasters were soon performing the duties of news anchors as they reported on the resulting pandemonium in the stadium. The earthquake killed a total of 63 people, while more than 3,000 others were injured and more than 100,000 buildings were damaged.#history #naturaldisaster"

541,damaged_infrastructure,"In an attack on the Iranian embassy in Lebanon at least 23 people have been killed and injured more than 140 others. These figures were the Lebanese Ministry of Health. According to security forces, a car bomb detonated near the building should be in the south of the capital Beirut.
Eyewitnesses tell of a total of two explosions that had occurred at intervals of about two minutes. The Botschaftsbau to have been damaged. First television pictures from the scene showed severe damage in the area. A dense column of smoke is about the district.
Iranian diplomats confirmed on Tuesday that the Iranian cultural attach√© Ibrahim al-Ansari was killed in the attack. Previously, the Iranians had declared all embassy staff had survived the assassination attempt. Ambassador Ghadanfar Rukn Abadi made ‚Äã‚Äãin an initial statement ‚ÄúZionist agents‚Äù responsible for the act.
""The Syrian government firmly condemns the terrorist attack carried out near the Iranian embassy in Beirut,"" state television said.
It said an ""odour of petrodollars comes from all the terrorist acts against Syria, Lebanon and Iraq,"" an apparent reference to Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which back Syria's uprising.
Iran also condemned the attack, accusing Israel and its ""mercenaries"" of responsibility. Israel immediately denied involvement.
The television channel of Hezbollah, al-Manar, and the state news agency reported that there had blasted out a suicide bomber on a motorcycle in the air, then a car bomb was detonated.
Iran‚Äôs Embassy is located near the city center of Beirut, controlled by the Hezbollah militia allied with Tehran. In these districts this year already several bombings had occurred, were blamed for the Syrian rebels. At least one other attack was prevented at the last minute. Iran and Hezbollah are in the Syrian civil war to the main ally of the dictator Bashar al-Assad.

If you are a passenger always wear a belt etc and think twice about who you let take you for a joy ride. When it goes wrong there is nothing you can do as it is out of you're controll. If you are the driver and think you are senna and can take corners way too fast just remember it's not just you're life it's the passenger's and the other innocent road users life's to. Don't be selfish save it for the right road and the right time or private property or the track. Always stick within you're own limits. Remember others can be hurt because of you're actions. Think twice stay safe.

The death toll from the Los Cristianos building collapse has risen this morning to six. The latest body was recovered just after 10am.
The emergency services believe there is just one more body to recover, however they are not ruling out discovering people who are unknown to them.
As it stands officially six people have lost their life, three were wounded and there is still one person unaccounted for.
The search effort will continue over the weekend and workers will be on shifts around the clock.
Yesterday afternoon Defense Minister, Pedro Moren√©s, visited the so-called Ground Zero, accompanied by Canarian President Fernando Clavijo and Tenerife Cabildo President Carlos Alonso.
Arona Mayor Jos√© Juli√°n Mena, will give a press conference with Pedro Moren√©s at Noon.

A powerful magnitude-7.3 #earthquake has rocked the northern border region between #Iran and #Iraq, killing more than 348 people in Iran and seven in Iraq and injuring thousands more. Local officials said the tolls would rise as search and rescue teams reached remote areas. More than 70,000 people were in need of emergency shelter, the Iranian Red Crescent said. The hardest hit province was #Kermanshah, where three days of mourning have been announced. More than 236 people died in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab, about 10 miles from the Iraq border.

711,damaged_infrastructure,"Five years ago today, I, along with all of the Patch editors on LI and in the metro NY area, was covering Hurricane Sandy as it walloped many of our communities, including mine: Lindenhurst, LI, NY.

I stayed online till the power went out in my house at 6P as the category 1 hurricane - later dubbed a superstorm - finally made landfall. The storm surge rocked my hometown, but you couldn't really assess the damage - which would take months and years to clean up - till the next day.

This photo of a house knocked off its foundation by the storm surge is one I took of one of the many homes devastated by Sandy when I toured the Village with the mayor and the emergency manager the next day. I posted my photo gallery that night. This home is no longer there.

That was just the start of the 5-year-long saga for many friends, family, neighbors and residents in Lindenhurst, and all along the south shore of LI, and all along every shoreline in the tri-state area. The saga, for many in Lindenhurst and LI and the tri-state area, sadly continues today. And the storm today underscores it all.

I will always be proud of the work I and my fellow Patch editors did before, during and after Sandy. I just wish our work could've prevented the devastation or got everyone back to pre-Sandy normal.

755,damaged_infrastructure,"Like most of you, I've seen many images of this house that went over the edge on North Beach during hurricane Irma, but  seeing it in person today was still quite a shock. I've surfed in front of this house off and on since the eighties, when the break was dubbed ""Doc's Reef"" in honor of Doc Chellemi, the father of a family of surfers that lived on 14th St. There was access through a little tunnel in the palmettos that not many knew about. The sand bars came and went, but there were times when it was good and well undersurfed. I kept surfing the spot when my friends Gil and Chelle bought a house on 13th St., one block north. We continued to have fun sessions off and on through the years, often just us but occasionally joined by a few of the neighbors. I dodged downpours and lightning bolts and took the path through the palmettos today for the first time in quite a while. It ended abruptly, with a 20-foot vertical drop to a now virtually-inaccessible beach. When I looked to my left this is what I saw. I'd like to think otherwise, but I'm convinced no amount of beach renourishment or coastal armoring will ever bring this place back to what it once was, and I can't help but feel the recent hurricanes signal the end of an era along the beaches of northeast Florida... #hurricaneirma #hurricanematthew #vilanobeach #northbeach #erosion #castlesmadeofsand #climatechange #sealevelrise #livingontheedge"

785,damaged_infrastructure,"Yesterday, I got into the worst car accident of my life in St. Petersburg, FL. Amidst all my errors, including driving citations I didn't hurt myself, nor the other driver, and I'm doing fine... Just frazzled. Between the pouring rain all day, breaking traffic surprised me, and as I went for my brakes, they gave out and my car completely locked up at 35MPH. Hydroplaning, I crashed. It was certainly a symbolic and chaotic end to driving for a while. Turns out I had a suspended license, without my knowledge, because of a few stupid mistakes I never took care of in terms of toll bills and timing. Moral of the story is: God gave me another chance to live again, to do things right and the junkyard took my car for $375, enough to break even from my tickets. For now, life is going to be tough and tricky, but the light will shine through like it always does, when the rain stops pouring down. ‚òî üöó Goodbye, old friend.

Roofs were torn off, houses were smashed to the ground and the floodwaters covered the roads and went into homes.

Many houses still sit without roofs and people are still living with friends or family. Life was already tough for most of the families here. Now, the overwhelming task of rebuilding seems so daunting. After they feed their families and send a child to school, there is nothing left. 
Since the hurricane, Foundation Guillaume has been able to have 6 houses built for 6 amazing families in our community. We are grateful to those who have partnered with us to make this happen! 
Please continue to pray for our community. 30,000 people call this area home and the needs are never ending.

It‚Äôs raining like crazy and we‚Äôre due for some strong wind gusts later on. Back in 2012 I remember spending a sleepless night closely watching 3 trees that I really thought were going to come down on my house. They didn‚Äôt but it was a close call. Once the storm passed I walked the neighborhood and was stunned by how many trees did come down. The one pictured was the biggest I had seen.

A massive shock for my sister and the family of the driver who caused the accident as the car wasn't his and they aren't insured.. my guess is he will be feeling it when the alcohol wears off.. #dontdrinkanddrive #staysafe #wearaseatbelt #caraccidents #everyonesok #shocked #wrecked #wreckedcar #police #ambulance #towed"
822,damaged_infrastructure,"Life carrying on amidst the rubble in Kathmandu Durbar Square
September 2015 
Two years ago today at 11:56 Nepal time a 7.8 Magnitude earthquake occured in Gorkha which killed nearly 9,000 people and injured nearly 22,000. It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal‚ÄìBihar earthquake.The ground motion recorded in Kathmandu valley was of low frequency which, along with its occurrence at an hour where many people in rural areas were working outdoors, decreased the loss of property and human life. Nevertheless, the earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing 21 making April 25, 2015 the deadliest day on the mountain in history. The earthquake triggered another huge avalanche in the Langtang valley, where 250 people were reported missing.

Hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless with entire villages flattened, across many districts of the country. 
I was privileged to visit Nepal in September and see first hand the amazing emergency relief and long term development  work being done by Act Alliance Partners including Christian Aid and the United Mission to Nepal. 
Your support for this work is of massive impact to the lives of so many people and the recovery work continues."

This Video demonstrates the importance of collapse zones.
Even though this is not a fire scene it is a great example of what a collapsing wall can look like and how far the building material can go. Use this video for trainings on establishing collapse zones!
Collapse Zones should be 1 1/2 or 2 times the height of the building.

116 people died among which are 85 South Africans. The church said it was caused by a plane which flew over the building at just that moment.
But the inquest which was instituted by the Lagos state government indicted the Founder of the church T.B. Joshua and the engineers of the building.
But nothing has come.out of that indictment till date."

A powerful magnitude-7.3 #earthquake has rocked the northern border region between #Iran and #Iraq, killing more than 348 people in Iran and seven in Iraq and injuring thousands more. Local officials said the tolls would rise as search and rescue teams reached remote areas. More than 70,000 people were in need of emergency shelter, the Iranian Red Crescent said. The hardest hit province was #Kermanshah, where three days of mourning have been announced. More than 236 people died in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab, about 10 miles from the Iraq border.

932,damaged_infrastructure,"#FirefighterFriday 
Large scale disasters are destructive and overwhelming; often times unexpected, yet not always our darkest hour. Fire departments, hospitals, law enforcement agencies and local/state/federal governments alike, all prepare for that ""once in a career disaster"", but when it hits, we often realize that we're never as ready as we'd hoped. 
Here in Southern California, we anticipate wildfires, earthquakes, floods (like the one you see my colleagues and me cleaning up from in the picture above) and other coastal related emergencies. üåä  It's rare, if ever, that we face such forces like the hurricanes or tornadoes, that the southern and eastern United States are dealing with right now. We are all praying for you over here on the West Coast üôèüèº #hurricaneharvey #hurricaneirma  #florida #texas  Regardless, the threat to our civilization is real, from both ends of the spectrum. Where I'm from, we work so very hard to ensure our communities are educated and prepared. From prevention teams, to emergency management officials, to community response teams (CERT) to the Red Cross, reducing our vulnerabilities yields the best chance of survival. Risk happens when we don't think about the potential. Many civilians in our populations find themselves trapped in a situation, unable to escape their predicament. üÜò Sadly, we as first responders and medical professionals, who want nothing more than to help our fellow human beings, are held at bay until we can safely take those calculated risks to save them. We risk a lot, to save a lot.... but only when it makes sense to do so.  How do you work with your large and small scale populations to make sure they're prepared? How do you explain to them when it's appropriate expect rescue? How do you get them involved so they have ownership in their survival? 
How do YOU train for the worst?"

962,damaged_infrastructure,"I read an article this weekend about Hurricane Sandy.  Apparently, it formed 5 years ago today.  Not really an anniversary I want to remember.  Living in Hoboken at the time, we got it pretty bad, but luckily our apartment was on the 5th floor.  I'll never forget wading through waist deep slop, a mix of Hudson River water, sewage and oil.  The whole town smelled like someone knocked over a porta-potty at low tide.  I remember eventually walking around to survey the damage and finding this boat up on the sidewalk, with a fairly apropos message scrawled on it.  That boat ended up staying on the sidewalk for weeks, maybe even months. It became something of a landmark and a reminder that our planet is pissed.  The silver lining of that storm was that it brought the good out in folks and brought them together.  I never saw a city unite and offer a helping hand like that before and maybe never will.  It certainly changed the tone of life in this area for pretty much every person who lived there.  I, for one, will always steer clear of living within flood range of any body of water because of that bitch named Sandy.  #newjersey #jersey #jerseystrong #hoboken #hurricanesandy #globalwarming #storm #travel #boat #travelstagram #weather #picoftheday"

999,damaged_infrastructure,"A letter on Yemen to every editor

It is deplorable that everybody has failed to extend what was a temporary ceasefire in Yemen. The conflict and the de facto blockade of the country has crippled its economy and put the lives of 26 million people at risk. Fuel supplies are exhausted, markets are running out of food, hospitals are without even basic medical supplies, power is intermittent and water networks are collapsing. 
Despite the broken ceasefire, which officially ended on Sunday, no progress has been made towards peace and fighting of a renewed intensity has begun again. Little is being done to stop the conflict. Nearly 2,000 Yemenis have been killed, over 7,000 injured ‚Äì and this is likely to be well under estimated. 
We welcome the proposed Geneva peace talks possibly slated for the end of May, but without an immediate and permanent ceasefire Yemen will buckle under the pressure of war. 
Oxfam implores international governments to take action now before the Geneva peace talks. The Saudi Arabian led coalition should let vessels carrying essential supplies dock at¬†
Yemen‚Äôs ports; there should be a complete arms embargo to everyone involved in the conflict; and funding to help Yemenis access clean water, food and basic medical treatment must be increased. 
A humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded. Without concerted international pressure, Yemen could become another of the world‚Äôs failed states. - Grace Ommer, Oxfam Yemen Country Director, 21 May 2015

Not long after that, the building collapsed, trapping thousands inside the debris. https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/disaster-area/id1071491908?mt=2https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/disaster-area/id1071491908?mt=2 #disaster #disasters #history #podcast #podcasts #podcaster #podcasting #historypodcast #historypodcasts #bangladesh #ranaplaza"

On my 200th post, I wish to share something different. Thats  my unforgettable experience with the worst hurricane in southern hemisphere. This mammoth category 5 cyclone with over 300km/hr gusts, not only destroyed infrastructure but took away lives and devastation was unlike anything I have seen. This entire experience personally was terrying but you do come out of it strongerüí™.
Several months after the hurricane, I had the privilege to visit Nadarivatu for a dental program. I found that school children were still studying without electricity and learning in cramped classrooms due to the extensive devastation. It was difficult for aid to reach this location, therefore rebuilding phase was slow. Yet they hardly complained. Actually, they were more afraid of the dentistüòê. It was estimated about 120,000 children been affected according to the UN.
Aftermath of the hurricane was a real struggle but thanks to foreign aid, communal friendship and comradery, Fiji was able to preservere and stand strong. It seemed like nothing can break the Fijian spirit.üá´üáØ‚ö°
With increasing global warming and climate change, these monster hurricanes will occur more frequently and with greater intensity.

Hope we are ready!üå¨Ô∏è"

From the displaced persons camp, we headed to our second stop of the day: an MSF-supported health centre. We set up a makeshift emergency room for people with paediatric and maternity complications. We've also had to rent minibuses to act as ambulances. Before, if people couldn't find someone willing to drive their loved ones to a hospital they would often have to go without medical care. 
It's dangerous being on the roads in Yemen, getting stuck behind cars makes everyone in the team worried as airstrikes can happen at any time. Thankfully, traffic wasn't bad today and we made it through OK, but the person driving this truck delivering apples wasn't as fortunate.

UPDATE: The 7.3 magnitude earthquake that shook the Iraq-Iran border has claimed more than 400 lives and caused thousands of injuries. According to BBC reporting, the earthquake is the largest and most deadly earthquake of the year, causing more than 7,000 injuries alone. Western Iran has suffered the most damage and is considered to be the largest to hit the area in history. Locals of the areas affected are searching frantically though rubble hoping to find their family members before it‚Äôs too late.

Jojutla is the town that was struck the hardest and sustained the most damage. 90% of the town is in rubble or has to be torn down. The devastation is shocking and eye opening of the power of Mother Earth. The spirits of the people are high and it seems that it has brought everyone together. I‚Äôve only been here a few times, but it will never be the same. My favorite places for a morning latte or pastor tacos have been wiped out. It‚Äôs encouraging to see the amount of construction going on around the town and I look forward to seeing the rebuild. No words can express how extremely thankful we are that the whole family is safe and sound and only sustained minor damage. 
This will be a working vacation but I am excited to be able to help anyway I can. Our first day was replacing a toilet. We will be replacing a wall and hauling out as much rubble as possible. 
My heart bleeds for those that lost everything and those that are not able to rebuild.  Fingers crossed that aid is on the way.

1113,damaged_infrastructure,"For example, you see that the extremely well-ordered and finely embroidered shirts, one over the other and one within the other, which are clothed on the earth from the species of #animals and #plants, are adorned and decked out from top to bottom with purposes and instances of #wisdom, and you know that the #earth revolves and is turned like an ecstatic Mevlevi in perfect order within most exalted aims. How is it then, as an #atheist published, they suppose the death-tainted events of the earth, like the #earthquake,  which resembles the earth's shaking off itself the weight of certain forms of #heedlessness of which it disapproves from #mankind, and especially from the #believers, to be without purpose and the result of chance? How is it that they show the grievous losses of all those stricken to be without recompense and to have gone for nothing, and cast them into a fearsome #despair ? They are both making a great #error and perpetrating a great #wrong. Indeed, such events occur at the command of One All-#Wise and All-#Compassionate, in order to transform the transient property of the believers into the equivalent of alms, and make it permanent. And they are atonement for their sins arising from ingratitude for bounties.

At least 320 people are dead after a truck bomb exploded in one of Mogadishu's busiest intersections during a traffic jam. This resulted in the collapse of a popular nearby hotel and other buildings in the area.

This is the worst terror attack in Somali history.

Another bomb detonated in the city's Medina District, killing 2 people.

The story is still developing.

Constantin Zhukov, reporting from Singapore.

Last year these days we experienced a strong earthquake here in Wellington. Although it hit north of south island, we experienced a long strong shake here in the south of north island... just before midnight. I was new in Wellington and alone. There are no words to explain how scared I was. I stayed awake till morning, listening to the radio which was saying there was tsunami alert for Wellington. It was a very bad night following with a few bad days... that night I expected any thing... nothing happened to the flat that I was living in and no one died in wellington... you know in New Zealand they tell you to stay indoors when a shake occurs simply because of this fact: building are safe here...
.

Last night, there was a strong quake in Iran and... that is Iran... building are not safe and you are told that you should not stay inside if a quake happens... you should run outside... run for your life... in Iran earthquakes kill and it is not God's rage or whatsoever! It is people's fault! It is poor management fault...
.
 Luckily my family and friends are safe, but lots of my countrymen are not... some have lost their beloved ones... some have lost their houses... and some are still under debris... please pray for them... this is the least we can do..."

If I remember correctly my dad got it for free a little over 10 years ago and it was in really good shape. All it needed was a head gasket. However, instead of fixing that cheap gasket and selling it, he gave it to my older brother and told him to tear it apart. This may seem like a tragedy and a waste, but it's kind of a beautiful tragedy. There are now plants growing in the backseat, the entire inside is covered in moss, and it's given a home to animals in the area. Life kinda works itself out.

Our Children MUST BE PREPARED.¬† What if you are not with your children when Disaster Strikes? What if there is so much destruction it takes you days, even weeks to get to them?¬† If we teach our children what we are learning of Disaster Preparedness, when that time comes, you will not have to worry about them.¬† They will know how to cook without power.¬† They will know how to purify water if it needs to be done.¬† They will know how to stay alive if we show them now.¬† Our Children are Gods, we are not doing them justice by learning how to prepare and not teaching them what we know.¬† Teach them everything you can about being prepared from first aid to cooking.¬† And on that day, maybe it may be you who needs first aid, they will know what to do.¬† Include the children in all of our planning.¬† Every one in our home will play a part in the ""Survival"" of our families.¬† Even if you have children away from home, send them information on preparing for and how to survive disaster.¬† We Must Prepare our Children.¬† We Must Prepare our Family. Whether they believe you or not. 
All of us, especially our children, need to understand that this earthquake is not the end.¬† It is only the beginning of sorrows.¬† There will be aftershocks and aftershocks, and more aftershocks.¬† There will be thousands of aftershocks After the original earthquake.¬† Some of which being as large as the original ""Major Earthquake."" The ground will shake for a long time and if we prepare our minds, prepare our children's minds for this now, we will not lose our minds as is going on in Japan.

The spiral staircase left from a ruined building, reminds of the davastating earthquake, which not only destroyed houses but also took thousands of people's lives.

From a documentary project I shot in the village of Marpak and surroundings, in the epicenter of the 2015 Nepali earthquake.

The village was completely destroyed during the earthquake, taking many lives and leaving people homeless. Nowdays they are living in tin temporary huts, waiting for the governmental help, which doesn't seem to come.
Despite the horrible event, most of the people I've met don't loose optimism. They smile, laugh, watch TV, children go to a temporary school... life continues and that is what matters the most now."

1342,damaged_infrastructure,"#NewYork has the power to counter a record greenhouse #gas surge!

Amidst all the mind-bending news of the week #terrorattack on a #Manhattan bike path; chair of a presidential campaign indicted for ‚Äúconspiracy against the =UnitedStates‚Äù ‚Äî one other story stands out for its long-term importance: researchers reported that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere surged by a record amount last year.

CO2 levels rose by 3.3 parts per million in the air, 50% faster than the average over the last decade. That means a few things, none of them good.

First, the last time there was this much carbon #dioxide in the atmosphere roughly three to five million years ago  the extra heat it trapped made #Earth a very different place. Among other things, sea levels rose as much as 20 meters.

Note that #TimesSquare is about 16 meters above sea level!

Second, this rise is coming much faster than anything in previous history. We're burning coal and oil and #gas much faster than #volcanoes have ever produced #CarbonDioxide before 10 to 20 times as fast.

Third, this year‚Äôs sudden spike may be a sign that the planet‚Äôs forest and ocean systems ‚Äî which slowly absorb carbon from the atmosphere ‚Äî may be beginning to falter. We know that forests and grasslands are stressed by the extra heat and dryness ‚Äî the cloud of carbon pouring out of Napa and Sonoma in California last month‚Äôs fires is testimony to that.

1368,damaged_infrastructure,"5 years ago this was my street where I lived... Hurricane Sandy came in with a vengeance and she changed my life forever. At 30 years old I had to start over again... I have wonderful friends and family that didn't let me do it alone. Their generosity was humbling. Sandy led me on a path to success. I am happily relocated in a wonderful area that has been good to me, I have built up a successful training career and I have made new friends for a lifetime. It wasn't easy, but for me it happened for a reason. My heart goes out to Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida...you will rebuild and you will be stronger than ever. Stuff comes and goes, we suffer from attachments. On this anniversary, let's celebrate our strength. Positive situations come from the negative. We persevere and keep moving forward! #hurricanesandy #2012 #ortleybeach #fielderave #humble #pride #friends #family #jerseystrong #sandyanniversary #5yearanniversary #onward #upward #helpeachother #loveeachother #bekind #charity #donate #helpinghands #rebuild #strongerthanever #puertorico #texas #florida"
