First of all being the real and historic neighbor of #Afghanistan we the people from #OccupiedBalochistan condemn Pakistan's terror attack on innocent women, children and people in the month of holly #Ramadan in strongest possible terms. 
We extend our sincere and deepest condolences to the brave people of #Afghanistan who have equally victims of Pakistani terrorism. We feel the pain equally because #Balochistan and #Afghanistan are two eyes of one body. 
We are very sad that still people in #Afghan government lending friendship hand towards #ISI which never forgive its own people. How they will forgive #Afghanistan? 
Two days before all the Scholars of Panjab #Lahore #Islamabad unanimously issued a #Fatwa terming the #Jihad,  #SuicideBombings as #Harram but today when they themselves conducting #SuicideBombing in #Kabul in the month of #RAMADAN none of these Panjabi Mullahs and #Muftis utter a single world against such inhuman acts by #ISI. 
Afghanistan government thinks if it helps to liberate #Balochistan and #Pashtunistna people #Pakistan #ISI will be unhappy?

Well for decades #ISI is killing your innocent women, children and countrymen if you support to #Liberate #Balochistan #Pashtunistan believe me the genocide of #BalochAfghan will stop forever. 
Bangladesh sacrificed 3 million #Bangali and today they are an independent State in 1971.

If Afghanistan could supported #FreeBalochistan movement during 1980 today there were no bomb blasts, suicide bombing on Afghan women and children because #NoPaksitanNoProblem.

#Afghanistan must come with courage to support #FreeBalochPashtunState to stop Pakistani terrorism forever. Isn't better to die once than everyday?

63,fire,"My heart aches for all the people affected by the nation's fires this season - both close to home and far away. The harrowing stories of the first responders and volunteers who put their lives in danger to save lives and homes are truly inspiring. And the stories from the victims gives me goosebumps (6 hours in a bone chilling pool to survive while everything around you melts?! Really?! And Izzy??? 😭).
//
On a personal note, it's been saddening to see many places I have found solace in over the years go up in flames. It wasn't until this last weekend that we smelled what typically is a happy campfire scent along our hike that it became real. After we got back to the trailhead under the aid of our headlamps and started the journey home in the dark, we saw miles of hillside lit up in flames along this FS road. While this one is ""contained"" it is truly eery to see entire hillsides ablaze, trees burning and the ground smoldering. //
Sending good thoughts and prayers to all of those affected by these crazy natural (and unfortunately some manmade) disasters. ✌🏽❤️🙏🏽"

101,fire,"“God is our refuge and strength, always ready to help in times of trouble. So we will not fear when earthquakes come and the mountains crumble into the sea. Let the oceans roar and foam. Let the mountains tremble as the waters surge! A river brings joy to the city of our God, the sacred home of the Most High. God dwells in that city; it cannot be destroyed. From the very break of day, God will protect it. The nations are in chaos, and their kingdoms crumble! God’s voice thunders, and the earth melts! The Lord of Heaven’s Armies is here among us; the God of Israel is our fortress. Come, see the glorious works of the Lord: See how he brings destruction upon the world. He causes wars to end throughout the earth. He breaks the bow and snaps the spear; he burns the shields with fire. “Be still, and know that I am God! I will be honored by every nation. I will be honored throughout the world.” The Lord of Heaven’s Armies is here among us; the God of Israel is our fortress.”
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭46:1-11‬ ‭NLT‬‬"
102,fire,"DAY 13 #EstivalSurvey - Back to Anchorage, Alaska

Even for a wordy SOB like me, it's hard to explain what we've been through the last 48 hours. We should've known camping next to a rusty torpedo that was attached to a dead tree like a gargoyle to an old church would be a sign of treachery to come. Still, we have managed to endure the smoke and flames of forrest fires, both figurative and literal, and we've rendezvoused with our crew in Anchorage along with our hot air balloon pilot, Mike. 
Tonight at 10:30 pm, we take flight.

Throwback from 2010, I remember sleeping in bed in these same apartments when all of a sudden my mom wakes me up at 2:00 a.m. and said, an apartment is on fire! I ran outside on the balcony to see all of building E burning. Everybody including the neighbors came out: Dallas firefighters from different stations, news, even the Red Cross. I ran to building D across the parking lot to watch upclose as the top two floors of the building collapsed. It was scary and the next day came. When I left for school, it was just the first floor remained but when I came home, it was nothing but a big pile of rubble surrounded by a fence for safety. I remember on the news that residents on the 3rd floor jumped to evacuate the building.

Safety was also a major concern Industrial work was very unsafe particularly the rail roads. Before the invention of the air brake trains employed men known as brakemen who job was ride on the top of the train and unscrew a mechanical wheel that unlocked braked by hand. It was a risky job because we’re shaken off the trains by rough tracks, steep bends and bridges. There are a number of accounts of men being crushed to death or horrifically scolded by steam from boilers. Carnegie Steel plant was home to one of the highest rates of industrial workplace injuries with an estimated 20% of employees being injured or killed between 1907 and 1910. The worst was perhaps in 1911 at the Triangle Shirt Factory in New York City where all 147 employees died in a fire. There were no proper fire escape and exits that could have been used were locked.

123,fire,"Glowing tin on the side of a garden shed at a fire we fought earlier this year. Fires with significant fuel loads output a lot of heat energy, and develop very quickly. Temperatures in this garden shed alone were upwards of 500 degrees Celsius when we first arrived, fuelled by an adjoining building, packed with numerous types of fuels and chemicals. Our first priority is always to protect exposures, and to work our way from the area of least damage, so as to prevent further fire spread and subsequent damage. Concentrating on the area that's burning the most isn't always the smartest way to tackle a decent sized fire.

The Borno State Commissioner of Police, Damien Chukwu, confirmed the attack to newsmen at a press briefing on Monday, and said that a male suicide bomber gained entry into the premises of the University of Maiduguri, and detonated a bomb (PBIED), strapped to his body, near the Rapid Response Services Office building.

Although it took many homes, jobs, loved ones, and continues to do so, it didn't take our love. I'm so thankful my family and friends are okay, and for my friends whom opened their arms and shelter to us. I'm still so uneasy not being able to go home, but I'm glad im still here and breathing. To everyone I know who lost their home or workplace, I am sorry you were so affected. I love you all, let me know how I can help. And to those who still have a home but can't go to it, hang in there friends. ❤

It made big headlines in Vietnam. 60 people killed in the huge fire and it was Vietnam's worst fire disaster. The event made me and the people of Saigon hard to forget. I also remember when I was in Saigon, my grandfather took me to the scene where it happened. The building was located in the heart of Saigon, just near Ben Thanh Market and opposite to Saigon Centre.

Roman's 1
18 The wrath of Elohim G-d ,is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness.6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
Mathew 24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.
9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.

The borough is among London’s most unequal, with extreme poverty and wealth living side by side. Data shows that the vicinity of the tower was among the top 10% most deprived areas in England in 2015, ranking alongside parts of Bradford and south Tyneside.

Yemen is one of the world's poorest and least developed nations. Traditionally neglected, almost half the country's residents are malnourished and have no access to clean water. Since March 19th hundreds of people have been killed and injured, including children. Hospitals are struggling to cope, shops have closed, water and electricity supplies have been cut off, tens of thousands of people have fled their homes, and much higher levels of displacement are anticipated. The humanitarian situation is heading for catastrophe. An estimated 15 million people - almost two-thirds of the population - need humanitarian assistance. The humanitarian situation is heading for catastrophe. Women and children in Yemen today are displaced and hungry. It is our duty to come to their aid and support them with that which Allah has granted us. Donate whatever you can for the sake of Allah.

While I was stranded in my apartment for 3 days and out of a home for a month, I know people who didn’t have a home to return to. It was an eerie and strange time for New Yorkers - especially when ALL OF THE LIGHTS WENT OUT -> the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, all of lower Manhattan! But it was also one of those beautiful times when people were more kind to one another. Friends and even acquaintances who had power offered food and shelter (@jlw5002 @erinttaylor). Strangers were doing the same for other strangers.  While we made it through and moved on with our lives, it’s crazy to think that some folks and business are still recovering. That’s some crazy shit. Mother Nature is a powerful thing.

47,flood,"Flashback to this time last year, when the Murray River was in flood, the largest flood in many decades. We'd had so much rain. This picture was taken from a helicopter we had to use to get to our house - once there we were unable to go anywhere until the floodwaters had receded enough to get our tractors through.  We were temporarily living on a little island with a paddock in each direction that was just above the water level!  Fast forward to October, 2017, and we desperately need rain. A good solid soaking. Our rainfall for the year to date is way below the average.  #murrayriver #nsw #riverina #farmlife #countrylife #floodwater #murrayfloods2016 #country_features #renegade_rural #moodynature #trb_rural #pocket_farms #photography"

92,flood,"It’s been 5 years since Hurricane Sandy rocked the north east. Even though this superstorm only made landfall as a Category 1, it is still the second costliest hurricane in US History. While I was stranded in my apartment for 3 days and out of a home for a month, I know people who didn’t have a home to return to. It was an eerie and strange time for New Yorkers - especially when ALL OF THE LIGHTS WENT OUT -> the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, all of lower Manhattan! But it was also one of those beautiful times when people were more kind to one another. Friends and even acquaintances who had power offered food and shelter (@jlw5002 @erinttaylor). Strangers were doing the same for other strangers.  While we made it through and moved on with our lives, it’s crazy to think that some folks and business are still recovering. That’s some crazy shit. Mother Nature is a powerful thing.

Today, close to a week since a devastating hurricane made landfall in Texas, some residents of the region are embarking on the long path toward recovery while others are still very much in the midst of crisis. In #Beaumont, a city of almost 120,000 people near the Louisiana border, running water was cut off by flooding, and the situation is dire. Brad Penisson, a fire rescue captain in Beaumont, said today that the city was setting up water distribution stations, and that restoring drinking water had become its most urgent priority.

(PLEASE give to an organization you trust to help Puerto Rico and the other islands affected by Hurricanes this summer) - With everyone in my neighborhood filled with loss, and depression, I learned how important my gift to produce smiles and laughter is. - Uncertainty is scary,  struggle is discouraging, but it gets better if you appreciate each new day & have the faith & Courage to keep moving forward towards your goals. 
5 years later,  I'm the best version of myself that I've been thus far! Good health,  Good job,  GOOD HAIR 😎 LOL,  still performing, & so much food in the fridge I write songs about it! 😂😂😂😂 I've always believed we help others through sharing our personal experiences.  So if anybody is going through any type of struggle,  I hope this helps! Keep your head up,  Keep laughing, Keep the faith & Keep moving forward!

The poor forecast resulted in sudden water release which surprised residents. As a consequence, they did not have time to evacuate."

A real estate expert, Emmanuel Gyane, has attributed Accra’s perennial floods mainly to a lack of monitoring systems in the city.Emmanuel Gyane, Chief Executive Officer of real estate company Altheo Ventures and Construction Limited, said that Accra’s perennial floods could be mitigated if city officials would impose measures to prevent the construction of buildings on waterways.Mr. Gyane explained that constructing a building on a waterway blocks the free flow of water bodies and, as a result, causes floods when it rains. He advocated the introduction of measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

248,flood,"Another year, another flood. The second wave of floods that has hit Assam this year has taken the total deaths count to 150 as on Friday, August 18, and hit nearly 33 lakh people in 25 districts of the State’s 32 districts, besides snapping rail connectivity to the Northeast India.  Of the 60 deaths in the second wave, 12 were reported from Morigaon, nine each in Kokrajhar and Dhubri and seven in Bongaigaon, reports TOI. The flood situation in the State remains critical with close to 1.39 lakh people taking shelter across 629 relief camps, according to reports by Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDM). Swollen by heavy monsoon this year,  Brahmaputra river and some of its tributaries are flowing over the danger limits. 
Photo caption: Mother and kid wait outside their partially submerged house (not seen in this image) as her husband paddles a makeshift raft made of banana trees at some flood affected village in morigaon district, 60 kilometres from guwahati in assam, during flood in July last year. 
The district is one of the major flood prone areas in the State. ASDMA reports state that this year, too, close to 5.30 lakh people has been hit by the deluge.

The Atlantic Ocean broke right through the Beach/streets and merged with the bay. (See pix). The flooding was simply unimaginable.

In the end, we found a way where the water level was not as deep so we could pass through. ☺ The film is from a street where we couldn't continue because the water got too deep further on.

The army and disaster management teams are doing their best to find those missing, but they are yet to make significant progress since the last successful rescue of Allauddin.

Four original residents and speculated two more guests are still missing.

The GTA Chief arrived early today, and has monitored the rescue efforts, tension evident in his face, reflective of the tension that entire Darjeeling feels today.

Some situations in life are simply depressing and difficult, times such as these leave you helpless and in silence. Hurricane Maria slammed the Island of Dominica, West Indies causing several immediate deaths with the death toll rising and people missing. The residents of Dominica are currently suffering from its aftermath with no food, shelter, and many difficulties. All we can do is console their loss and support them emotionally and financially. .

40,damaged_infrastructure,"Hurricane Sandy. I can't believe it has been 5 years!! The damage to NJ was horrible, but the damage to my childhood town Tottenville, Staten Island was devastating. 💔 I volunteered every weekend. I slept in my freezing car friday & sat nights. I met some amazing people volunteering. 💙 The first picture is of Rockaway St, the bottom right house was the first house I lived in. They only had flooding. The yellow restaurant next to it was the Rockaway Cove, it was the closest to the beach, where I would always drink Shirley Temples. The top house became a nationwide known picture during Sandy. Their granddaughter Cindy was in my grade & their 2 sons Phil & Tony were good friends of my dad.  Yetman Ave was the next block. My cousins Craig & Mark used to live by the house that was swept away where the 14 y/o Angela & her father were killed. The picture of their stairs was all that was left. The house on Yetman which became the volunteer house, was where 2 girls I worshiped growing up lived & my cousin Billy ended up marrying Sue. It was amazing seeing people dropping off goods, local donations & people drove from all over the country. People would drop off pictures & things they found. The one picture is a girl I went to elementary & middle school with. That gave me chills. Someone gave us tulips & they lasted months. A few months later I volunteered with Starbucks at the other end of the Island.

Nous installons une petite salle d’urgence pour les personnes avec des complications pédiatriques ou maternelles. Nous avons dû louer des minibus pour en faire des ambulances. Auparavant si les gens ne trouvaient personne pour conduire leurs proches à l’hôpital, ils devaient y aller sans assistance médicale.
Il est dangereux d’être sur les routes au Yémen. Rester coincer derrière des voitures inquiète toute l’équipe car les frappes aériennes peuvent arriver à tout moment. Heureusement, il y avait peu de trafic aujourd’hui et nous en sommes sortis indemnes, par contre nous ne pouvons pas en dire autant pour ce camion.

69,damaged_infrastructure,"@Regrann from @karriem_muhammad -  #DisasterPreparedness: #Christ warns us that a Major #Earthquake will soon Destroy Many Cities in America.

So we Must Prepare. We must store some food and water in our homes. 2-3 weeks to 2-3 months worth. And ways to cook and clean. First aid supplies.

Why?

Because after this Major Earthquake nearly every street, nearly every road, highway, will be destroyed.

No food coming in or out. No HELP coming to us. 
And all that we have in our homes is all that we will have. What if it takes three weeks to get the road fixed to get food into your city. Could you survive for three weeks with what you currently have in your home? 
How much water do you have stored? After this earthquake we won't be able to just turn on the water. There will be no water coming out because all the pipes, all the water mains will be destroyed. 
To learn how to prepare. To learn how much food and water we need, how to store it, and the best foods to store, send me an email at writermdm@gmail.com and I'll send you an disaster preparedness manual. - #regrann"

برای متقاعد کردن من گفت: اینها خارجی هستند.

تا ماه ها بتول خانم برای روضه ماهانه اش از چای های خارجی کمک شده برای زلزله زدگان رودبار دم می کرد.  خانم های حاضر در روضه هم همگی از کیفیت خوب جنس های خارجی تعریف ها می کردند.  مطمئن نیستم که اون خانم های پیچیده در چادرهای سیاه که هر وقت دستهای پر النگو و انگشترشون رو از چادر بیرون می آوردند تا چای بردارند، حسرت می خوردند که شوهرشون در هلال احمر کار نمی کنه یا نه.... ولی من هنوزم که هنوزه با عصبانیت به این فکر می کنم که لحاف و تشک های پیچیده در چادر شب های بافت یزدم، جهیزیه  و سیسمونی دختر کدوم یکی از حاج آقاهای شهر شد............"

108,damaged_infrastructure,"(#CNN) At least 452 people were #killed and thousands #injured after a powerful #earthquake struck near the border of #Iran and #Iraq late Sunday. Earthquake is the #deadliest of the year, and was felt as far away as #Turkey and #Pakistan. Around 100 of the dead are believed to be from one town in Iran's #Kermanshah province, the country's semi-official Mehr news agency reported. Iran: 445 people confirmed dead, 7,100 injured, Iran's Press TV has reported Monday afternoon. Northern Iraq: 7 people dead in the semi-autonomous #Kurdish region, said Rekawt Hama Rasheed, the health minister of the Kurdish Regional Government. Iraq's health ministry added that 535 people were injured. The earthquake hit late Sunday night with the epicenter in a rural area on the Iranian side of the border, just south of the Iraqi city of #Halabja, according to the #US #Geological #Survey, which tracks earthquake activity around the world.  The quake was at a depth of 23 km (just over 14 miles), which is considered #shallow, according to the survey. It was felt across the region with aftershocks hitting Pakistan, #Lebanon, #Kuwait and Turkey, news agencies in those countries reported.

This one was the most intact and probably just got rolled down the hill, when the owner didn't want it anymore.

The other car wrecks looked more like they've just gotten thrown off a cliff and tumbled the way down here. You barely could recognize which model it was.

Well, I suppose that's how you got rid of your car in the 60’s. :D

MAF is working in support of our partner @samaritanspurse In the Caribbean so that those in need can be reached sooner and more efficiently.
.
Our aircraft can be airborne within hours of a disaster – helping build a picture of the devastation and need from the air. MAF can assist in the aftermath ferrying essential supplies of tarpaulins, food, water and medical supplies and bringing in teams of workers to areas where roads and bridges have been washed away – as they were in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew in October 2016.
.
Since 1945 MAF has enabled the work of churches, relief organisations, missionaries, medical teams, development agencies, and others working to share God’s love and make life better for those who live in the most isolated parts of the world. In recent years, MAF has responded to disasters in Haiti following Hurricane Matthew, in Nepal following two deadly earthquakes in 2015, and in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.

Praying fervently for those in Iran and Iraq who are injured, who are missing, those who have been traumatized, and the families who have lost loved ones. May the Prince of Peace pour out His shalom onto them.

The guy coordinating at the time was a fill in that lived two blocks away and managed events and concerts. Here he was managing an evac center. We all knew eachother briefly on a first name orange painters tape name tag. The group I worked with we unloaded supplies and loaded trucks heading to other centers great guys. The last day we loaded semi truck. The forklift got stuck and I went to help push it out. Some of the new fresh volunteers had alot to say, saying we'd never push it out of the ditch, well me and Greg pushed it out and finished the job. There was a flood of new volunteers and we figured we'd disband and go our separate ways. I regret not taking a photo of them."

214,damaged_infrastructure,"این هفته درباره ی ولتر * می خواندم ، درباره شعر طولانی اش برای زلزله لیزبن و اثرات این زلزله بر جهانبینی او و جهانبینی مردم و دیدشان به مذهب. 
طبیعت خشن و بی رحم و کور است، برای هیچ دو عاشقی ،برای هیچ مادر و فرزندی،  برای هیچ کس و هیچ چیز ارزش خاصی قائل نیست. درکی ندارد و کنترلی هم ندارد و این تکان دهنده و رنج آور است مخصوصا وقتی می دانی نجات دهنده ای نیست،هشدار دهنده و محافظی نیست ،یک آن با واقعیت دردناکی روبرو میشوی و آن این است که دنیا و طبیعت از کشتن شرم ندارند و هیچکس نمیتواند کاری کند، نمیشود اعتراض کرد، امیدی برای تغییر نیست، همه کاملا بی دفاع و شکننده اند. هیچوقت فکر نمی کردم همین هفته همچین زلزله ای در ایران اتفاق بیفتد. وقایع اینچنینی واقعا رنج آور و دردناک اند. آدم نمی داند چه بگوید و همزمان نمی تواند چیزی نگوید چون درد مادر گفتن است.  انچه هست استیصال است و رنج. 
اگر کمکی از دستتان ساخته است دریغ نکنید. اگر در حال جمع آوری کمک در خارج از کشور هستید و مراکز معتبری برای این کار میشناسید همرسان کنید و اطلاعات را در اختیار دیگر دوستان قرار دهید
.
.
از یاد نبریم که تعداد تلفات بالای زلزله در ایران رابطه تنگاتنگ با بی کفایتی مسئولین، فساد و ساختمان سازی غیر استاندارد و البته خرج کردن اموال مردم خارج از مرزهای ایران دارد (در شرایطی که هر لحظه برای زیر آوار ماندگان میتواند مرگ زا باشد، روستاهایی که فاصله کمی با مرکز زلزله دارند هنوز کمک و حتی آب خوردن و پتو و .. دریافت نکرده اند. این در حالیست که با پول همین مردم در کشورهای دیگر بیمارستان میسازند) * #Voltaire

On #ThisDayinHistory 1989, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the San Francisco Bay Area. On that day, the Bay Area was buzzing about baseball. The Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants, both local teams, had reached the World Series. The third game of the series was scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. at San Francisco’s Candlestick Park. But, just prior to the game, a magnitude 6.9 quake rocked the San Francisco Bay region. Though the stadium withstood the shaking, other parts of the Bay Area were not as fortunate. Sixty-seven people were killed as a result of the 15-second quake, and more than 3,000 others were injured. Additionally more than $5 billion in damages were caused by the tectonic activity. In the quake’s aftermath, San Francisco and other communities enacted strict regulations requiring unreinforced masonry buildings to be retrofitted. #SanFrancisco #Earthquake #1989 #WorldSeries #quake #naturaldisaster"

247,damaged_infrastructure,"On October 30th 2016 at 7.40 in the morning an earthquake of magnitudo 6.5 destroys definitively what remained in the center of Italy after the previous earthquakes. It's been a year. Millions of tons of ruins nip in the bud any kind of reconstruction. Half a milion of italians are still forced to face destruction. Estimated damages of eight billion. Numbers. Behind the numbers there are people who resist, who do not give up, who are desperately trying to restart and to rebuild. They are left alone. Because the state government is not there. I had promised that I would not have forgotten and so I did. My thoughts have been with you every single day. Marchigiani. Abruzzesi. Umbri. I will always be with you.

Après la démolition, je suis retourné sur le site, cherchant des traces de cette peinture. En documentant les murs rouges qui ont été réduits en morceaux de plus en plus petits pendant la destruction du bâtiment, j'ai traqué le destin de cette pièce rouge qui, finalement, devait disparaître dans le vide comme un morceau de béton anonyme. La pièce rouge était un espace privé qui s'est effacé lorsqu'il a été confronté à un système de redéveloppement. »

274,damaged_infrastructure,"RepostBy @ummahyahseark: ""Greetings family,
as many people in the United States prepare this week to give thanks for everything that they've been blessed with, there are human beings in the Caribbean islands that are still devastated from hurricanes Irma and Maria. These people are our mothers, fathers, grandparents, sisters, brothers, children.. They have had no electricity, no cell phone service, no food to eat nor any clean water to drink, some for months now. They are in need of support and resources and are lacking both from the U.S., so the people are coming together to rebuild, renew and restore their homeland. If you are a part of the Rastafari community, or if you love reggae music, you may know that many wholesome artists (Midnite, Akae Beka, Dezarie, Zion I Kings) come from the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and are actively trying to rebuild their communities, while helping to sustain the life of the people every day by ways of basic needs (food, clean water, shelter).
My brother is traveling to Puerto Rico this week to help rebuild the community, and is bringing a suitcase of supplies to those in need. I am asking for donations to buy supplies such as LifeStraws (portable water filters), Flashlights, and any other necessities. 
I will pick someone from the list of contributers to recieve a gift for their help.. your choice of bracelets (men, women, and children styles and sizes) wire wrapped necklaces, and other customizable gifts. 
Thank you in advanced to anyone that is willing and able to donate to help out. Every 'whole' is made up of individual parts.. there are at least 7 billion human beings inhabiting the Earth right now, I am one of them and you are too. If one part of the world suffers then the whole world will suffer. We must do our part to help each other out in whatever way we are able to, for even the smallest of good deeds make a difference. 
Please contact me of you have any questions..
give thanks !

331,damaged_infrastructure,"Галина Богданова - владелец кафе, которое во время боев под Славянском было полностью разбито минометным снарядом. Галина вспоминает как более чем 20 лет назад начинала свой бизнес с небольшого ларька на этом месте, и как со временем смогла развить свое дело до приличного кафе. В одну секунду один снаряд перечеркнул все годы ее работы. Но она не отчаивается - рада, что все остались живы из ее родни, и готова снова начинать свое дело с маленького ларька - все как 20 лет назад... Иногда цинизм государства доходит до полного абсурда: с нее все еще требуют уплаты налогов, а обещанная оценочная комиссия вот уже как месяц пытается прийти, и все никак. А ведь женщина не просит, что бы ей возместили все полностью - понимает, что сейчас война, но, на хотя бы минимальную поддержку от государства все же надеется, как то беспроцентный кредит, либо частичная помощь в отстройке здания. На самом деле такие сильные духом люди как Галина встречаются не каждый день, поэтому, хотелось бы ей помочь. Если кто то прочтет это, и поймет, что у него есть возможность помочь каким либо способом, то я и она будем очень благодарны. Контактами с ней я обменялся, все вопросы и предложения можно писать мне в сообщения.  photo by @romanpilipey / @epaphotos  #ukraine  #war #help #slaviansk #destroyedbuilding #помощь #война #славянск"

The curious sight drew many people down to the north slip at the docks to what was going on, a site which would soon turn into the most dangerous spot they could be. https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/disaster-area/id1071491908?mt=2&i=1000392317969 #history #historypodcast #historypodcasts #podcast #podcasts #podcaster #podcasters #disaster #disasters #texascitydisaster #texascity"

597,damaged_infrastructure,"Throwback to last year. Please take a minute to learn something from this. A pal at the time gave me a lift home from work. If you are a passenger always wear a belt etc and think twice about who you let take you for a joy ride. When it goes wrong there is nothing you can do as it is out of you're controll. If you are the driver and think you are senna and can take corners way too fast just remember it's not just you're life it's the passenger's and the other innocent road users life's to. Don't be selfish save it for the right road and the right time or private property or the track. Always stick within you're own limits. Remember others can be hurt because of you're actions. Think twice stay safe.

The death toll from the Los Cristianos building collapse has risen this morning to six. The latest body was recovered just after 10am.
The emergency services believe there is just one more body to recover, however they are not ruling out discovering people who are unknown to them.
As it stands officially six people have lost their life, three were wounded and there is still one person unaccounted for.
The search effort will continue over the weekend and workers will be on shifts around the clock.
Yesterday afternoon Defense Minister, Pedro Morenés, visited the so-called Ground Zero, accompanied by Canarian President Fernando Clavijo and Tenerife Cabildo President Carlos Alonso.
Arona Mayor José Julián Mena, will give a press conference with Pedro Morenés at Noon.

A powerful magnitude-7.3 #earthquake has rocked the northern border region between #Iran and #Iraq, killing more than 348 people in Iran and seven in Iraq and injuring thousands more. Local officials said the tolls would rise as search and rescue teams reached remote areas. More than 70,000 people were in need of emergency shelter, the Iranian Red Crescent said. The hardest hit province was #Kermanshah, where three days of mourning have been announced. More than 236 people died in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab, about 10 miles from the Iraq border.

711,damaged_infrastructure,"Five years ago today, I, along with all of the Patch editors on LI and in the metro NY area, was covering Hurricane Sandy as it walloped many of our communities, including mine: Lindenhurst, LI, NY.

I stayed online till the power went out in my house at 6P as the category 1 hurricane - later dubbed a superstorm - finally made landfall. The storm surge rocked my hometown, but you couldn't really assess the damage - which would take months and years to clean up - till the next day.

This photo of a house knocked off its foundation by the storm surge is one I took of one of the many homes devastated by Sandy when I toured the Village with the mayor and the emergency manager the next day. I posted my photo gallery that night. This home is no longer there.

That was just the start of the 5-year-long saga for many friends, family, neighbors and residents in Lindenhurst, and all along the south shore of LI, and all along every shoreline in the tri-state area. The saga, for many in Lindenhurst and LI and the tri-state area, sadly continues today. And the storm today underscores it all.

I will always be proud of the work I and my fellow Patch editors did before, during and after Sandy. I just wish our work could've prevented the devastation or got everyone back to pre-Sandy normal.

755,damaged_infrastructure,"Like most of you, I've seen many images of this house that went over the edge on North Beach during hurricane Irma, but  seeing it in person today was still quite a shock. I've surfed in front of this house off and on since the eighties, when the break was dubbed ""Doc's Reef"" in honor of Doc Chellemi, the father of a family of surfers that lived on 14th St. There was access through a little tunnel in the palmettos that not many knew about. The sand bars came and went, but there were times when it was good and well undersurfed. I kept surfing the spot when my friends Gil and Chelle bought a house on 13th St., one block north. We continued to have fun sessions off and on through the years, often just us but occasionally joined by a few of the neighbors. I dodged downpours and lightning bolts and took the path through the palmettos today for the first time in quite a while. It ended abruptly, with a 20-foot vertical drop to a now virtually-inaccessible beach. When I looked to my left this is what I saw. I'd like to think otherwise, but I'm convinced no amount of beach renourishment or coastal armoring will ever bring this place back to what it once was, and I can't help but feel the recent hurricanes signal the end of an era along the beaches of northeast Florida... #hurricaneirma #hurricanematthew #vilanobeach #northbeach #erosion #castlesmadeofsand #climatechange #sealevelrise #livingontheedge"

785,damaged_infrastructure,"Yesterday, I got into the worst car accident of my life in St. Petersburg, FL. Amidst all my errors, including driving citations I didn't hurt myself, nor the other driver, and I'm doing fine... Just frazzled. Between the pouring rain all day, breaking traffic surprised me, and as I went for my brakes, they gave out and my car completely locked up at 35MPH. Hydroplaning, I crashed. It was certainly a symbolic and chaotic end to driving for a while. Turns out I had a suspended license, without my knowledge, because of a few stupid mistakes I never took care of in terms of toll bills and timing. Moral of the story is: God gave me another chance to live again, to do things right and the junkyard took my car for $375, enough to break even from my tickets. For now, life is going to be tough and tricky, but the light will shine through like it always does, when the rain stops pouring down. ☔ 🚗 Goodbye, old friend. Count your blessings and stay on top of your driving situations. Don't fall behind on payments, always check your driving status. Be safe out there, the world needs YOU today...AND tomorrow, too. #CarAccident #LuckyToBeAlive #pouringrain #godisgood #secondchances #wreckedcar #countyourblessings #doingthingsrightthistime"

Roofs were torn off, houses were smashed to the ground and the floodwaters covered the roads and went into homes.

Many houses still sit without roofs and people are still living with friends or family. Life was already tough for most of the families here. Now, the overwhelming task of rebuilding seems so daunting. After they feed their families and send a child to school, there is nothing left. 
Since the hurricane, Foundation Guillaume has been able to have 6 houses built for 6 amazing families in our community. We are grateful to those who have partnered with us to make this happen! 
Please continue to pray for our community. 30,000 people call this area home and the needs are never ending.

820,damaged_infrastructure,"So five years ago to this day 10/29/2012, NYC was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy. Ironic that today we are dealing with a very nasty storm though not nearly as destructive. It’s raining like crazy and we’re due for some strong wind gusts later on. Back in 2012 I remember spending a sleepless night closely watching 3 trees that I really thought were going to come down on my house. They didn’t but it was a close call. Once the storm passed I walked the neighborhood and was stunned by how many trees did come down. The one pictured was the biggest I had seen. Amazingly I think I only saw one tree down in all of #AstoriaPark #hurricanesandy #superstormsandy #hurricane #Astoria #astoryofastoria #boromagazine @boromagazine"

A massive shock for my sister and the family of the driver who caused the accident as the car wasn't his and they aren't insured.. my guess is he will be feeling it when the alcohol wears off.. #dontdrinkanddrive #staysafe #wearaseatbelt #caraccidents #everyonesok #shocked #wrecked #wreckedcar #police #ambulance #towed"

September 2015 
Two years ago today at 11:56 Nepal time a 7.8 Magnitude earthquake occured in Gorkha which killed nearly 9,000 people and injured nearly 22,000. It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake.The ground motion recorded in Kathmandu valley was of low frequency which, along with its occurrence at an hour where many people in rural areas were working outdoors, decreased the loss of property and human life. Nevertheless, the earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing 21 making April 25, 2015 the deadliest day on the mountain in history. The earthquake triggered another huge avalanche in the Langtang valley, where 250 people were reported missing.

Hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless with entire villages flattened, across many districts of the country. 
I was privileged to visit Nepal in September and see first hand the amazing emergency relief and long term development  work being done by Act Alliance Partners including Christian Aid and the United Mission to Nepal. 
Your support for this work is of massive impact to the lives of so many people and the recovery work continues."

This Video demonstrates the importance of collapse zones.
Even though this is not a fire scene it is a great example of what a collapsing wall can look like and how far the building material can go. Use this video for trainings on establishing collapse zones!
Collapse Zones should be 1 1/2 or 2 times the height of the building.

Our roof on the house was damaged and one of the huge pine trees fell on our barn 😢 Stay safe northern family and friends. Thinking of you.

At least 20 people have been killed and several others wounded in a massive truck bomb attack outside a hotel in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, police said, with officials fearing many casualties from the unusually large explosion.

""We know that at least 20 civilians are dead while dozens of others are wounded,"" Abdullahi Nur, a police officer who was in the area, told Reuters news agency. ""The death toll will surely rise.

888,damaged_infrastructure,"The trial of two engineers indicted for the September 2014 Synagogue church building collapse was on Thursday adjourned to a date in February due to the absence of a prosecution witness said to be overseas.

The engineers, Akinbela Fatiregun and Oladele Ogundeji were in charge of building the collapsed Synagogue Church guest house that led to the death of over 100 worshippers, majority of them South Africans.

They are are being prosecuted by the Lagos state government before Justice Lateef Lawal-Akapo of the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja.

A powerful magnitude-7.3 #earthquake has rocked the northern border region between #Iran and #Iraq, killing more than 348 people in Iran and seven in Iraq and injuring thousands more. Local officials said the tolls would rise as search and rescue teams reached remote areas. More than 70,000 people were in need of emergency shelter, the Iranian Red Crescent said. The hardest hit province was #Kermanshah, where three days of mourning have been announced. More than 236 people died in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab, about 10 miles from the Iraq border.

Large scale disasters are destructive and overwhelming; often times unexpected, yet not always our darkest hour. Fire departments, hospitals, law enforcement agencies and local/state/federal governments alike, all prepare for that ""once in a career disaster"", but when it hits, we often realize that we're never as ready as we'd hoped. 
Here in Southern California, we anticipate wildfires, earthquakes, floods (like the one you see my colleagues and me cleaning up from in the picture above) and other coastal related emergencies. 🌊  It's rare, if ever, that we face such forces like the hurricanes or tornadoes, that the southern and eastern United States are dealing with right now. We are all praying for you over here on the West Coast 🙏🏼 #hurricaneharvey #hurricaneirma  #florida #texas  Regardless, the threat to our civilization is real, from both ends of the spectrum. Where I'm from, we work so very hard to ensure our communities are educated and prepared. From prevention teams, to emergency management officials, to community response teams (CERT) to the Red Cross, reducing our vulnerabilities yields the best chance of survival. Risk happens when we don't think about the potential. Many civilians in our populations find themselves trapped in a situation, unable to escape their predicament. 🆘 Sadly, we as first responders and medical professionals, who want nothing more than to help our fellow human beings, are held at bay until we can safely take those calculated risks to save them. We risk a lot, to save a lot.... but only when it makes sense to do so.  How do you work with your large and small scale populations to make sure they're prepared? How do you explain to them when it's appropriate expect rescue? How do you get them involved so they have ownership in their survival? 
How do YOU train for the worst?"

962,damaged_infrastructure,"I read an article this weekend about Hurricane Sandy.  Apparently, it formed 5 years ago today.  Not really an anniversary I want to remember.  Living in Hoboken at the time, we got it pretty bad, but luckily our apartment was on the 5th floor.  I'll never forget wading through waist deep slop, a mix of Hudson River water, sewage and oil.  The whole town smelled like someone knocked over a porta-potty at low tide.  I remember eventually walking around to survey the damage and finding this boat up on the sidewalk, with a fairly apropos message scrawled on it.  That boat ended up staying on the sidewalk for weeks, maybe even months. It became something of a landmark and a reminder that our planet is pissed.  The silver lining of that storm was that it brought the good out in folks and brought them together.  I never saw a city unite and offer a helping hand like that before and maybe never will.  It certainly changed the tone of life in this area for pretty much every person who lived there.  I, for one, will always steer clear of living within flood range of any body of water because of that bitch named Sandy.  #newjersey #jersey #jerseystrong #hoboken #hurricanesandy #globalwarming #storm #travel #boat #travelstagram #weather #picoftheday"

999,damaged_infrastructure,"A letter on Yemen to every editor

It is deplorable that everybody has failed to extend what was a temporary ceasefire in Yemen. The conflict and the de facto blockade of the country has crippled its economy and put the lives of 26 million people at risk. Fuel supplies are exhausted, markets are running out of food, hospitals are without even basic medical supplies, power is intermittent and water networks are collapsing. 
Despite the broken ceasefire, which officially ended on Sunday, no progress has been made towards peace and fighting of a renewed intensity has begun again. Little is being done to stop the conflict. Nearly 2,000 Yemenis have been killed, over 7,000 injured – and this is likely to be well under estimated. 
We welcome the proposed Geneva peace talks possibly slated for the end of May, but without an immediate and permanent ceasefire Yemen will buckle under the pressure of war. 
Oxfam implores international governments to take action now before the Geneva peace talks. The Saudi Arabian led coalition should let vessels carrying essential supplies dock at 
Yemen’s ports; there should be a complete arms embargo to everyone involved in the conflict; and funding to help Yemenis access clean water, food and basic medical treatment must be increased. 
A humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded. Without concerted international pressure, Yemen could become another of the world’s failed states. - Grace Ommer, Oxfam Yemen Country Director, 21 May 2015

On my 200th post, I wish to share something different. Thats  my unforgettable experience with the worst hurricane in southern hemisphere. This mammoth category 5 cyclone with over 300km/hr gusts, not only destroyed infrastructure but took away lives and devastation was unlike anything I have seen. This entire experience personally was terrying but you do come out of it stronger💪.
Several months after the hurricane, I had the privilege to visit Nadarivatu for a dental program. I found that school children were still studying without electricity and learning in cramped classrooms due to the extensive devastation. It was difficult for aid to reach this location, therefore rebuilding phase was slow. Yet they hardly complained. Actually, they were more afraid of the dentist😐. It was estimated about 120,000 children been affected according to the UN.
Aftermath of the hurricane was a real struggle but thanks to foreign aid, communal friendship and comradery, Fiji was able to preservere and stand strong. It seemed like nothing can break the Fijian spirit.🇫🇯⚡
With increasing global warming and climate change, these monster hurricanes will occur more frequently and with greater intensity.
........
Hope we are ready!🌬️"

From the displaced persons camp, we headed to our second stop of the day: an MSF-supported health centre. We set up a makeshift emergency room for people with paediatric and maternity complications. We've also had to rent minibuses to act as ambulances. Before, if people couldn't find someone willing to drive their loved ones to a hospital they would often have to go without medical care. 
It's dangerous being on the roads in Yemen, getting stuck behind cars makes everyone in the team worried as airstrikes can happen at any time. Thankfully, traffic wasn't bad today and we made it through OK, but the person driving this truck delivering apples wasn't as fortunate.

1070,damaged_infrastructure,"Five years ago today, Superstorm Sandy, slammed the East Coast. The storm made landfall on Oct. 29, 2012, sending floodwaters pouring across New Jersey, Long Island, and NYC, flooding the city's subway system and knocking out power to the southern part of Manhattan.

In honor of the people who suffered through this devastating storm five years ago, here is a short documentary I directed about one man's story to rebuild his home in Staten Island. .

پیشینه ای را دور می ریزد

زمین
جا می خورد در خویش
و هر انگاره ای را
می کند فریاد

زمین می لرزد و آشوب می ریزد
چنان خروارها
- مغضـوب -
می ریزد

به یک آن،
پیکر زندانیانِ زندگی!
میانِ آجر و آهن
ملاتِ تازه می یابد
قوامی دیرپا
در جنبشی خونین

هر آنچه شهر می خواندند

1084,damaged_infrastructure,"📸Farzad Menati/Tasnim News Agency, via Associated Press 
UPDATE: The 7.3 magnitude earthquake that shook the Iraq-Iran border has claimed more than 400 lives and caused thousands of injuries. According to BBC reporting, the earthquake is the largest and most deadly earthquake of the year, causing more than 7,000 injuries alone. Western Iran has suffered the most damage and is considered to be the largest to hit the area in history. Locals of the areas affected are searching frantically though rubble hoping to find their family members before it’s too late. 
Buildings and homes have collapsed leaving many without the most basic of needs such as good, water, electricity, and housing."

1102,damaged_infrastructure,"The earthquake that rocked Puebla, Mexico (which borders Morelos) on September 19th is roughly 80 miles away from Jojutla, my husbands hometown.  Jojutla is the town that was struck the hardest and sustained the most damage. 90% of the town is in rubble or has to be torn down. The devastation is shocking and eye opening of the power of Mother Earth. The spirits of the people are high and it seems that it has brought everyone together. I’ve only been here a few times, but it will never be the same. My favorite places for a morning latte or pastor tacos have been wiped out. It’s encouraging to see the amount of construction going on around the town and I look forward to seeing the rebuild. No words can express how extremely thankful we are that the whole family is safe and sound and only sustained minor damage. 
This will be a working vacation but I am excited to be able to help anyway I can. Our first day was replacing a toilet. We will be replacing a wall and hauling out as much rubble as possible. 
My heart bleeds for those that lost everything and those that are not able to rebuild.  Fingers crossed that aid is on the way.

زمین گهواره من از چه رو اینگونه لرزانی
تورا آباد کردم از چه رو خواهی تو ویرانی

بسی نخل تن آور بار آوردم به صحرایت
بسی سرسبزی و شادی نمودم بر تو ارزانی

برآوردم بنا از خشت وگل تا آسمان بردم
تو خاکش باز کردی از چه رو اینسان به آسانی

به سختی من برآوردم بسی محصول از خاکت
ولی محصول عمرم را ربودستی به یک آنی

بسی گُل پروریدم من به دامانت ، ندانستم
گُل نشکفته ام را می کنی در خاک مهمانی

دو دست یاریم بشکسته پایم مانده در آوار
زن وفرزند من مردند در وضعی که می دانی

صدای ناله ای از کودک همسایه می آید
کنار پیکر بی جان مادر گشته زندانی

خدایا یاریم ده تا رها گردم از این محنت
به یاری تو و با همّت افراد ایرانی

1113,damaged_infrastructure,"For example, you see that the extremely well-ordered and finely embroidered shirts, one over the other and one within the other, which are clothed on the earth from the species of #animals and #plants, are adorned and decked out from top to bottom with purposes and instances of #wisdom, and you know that the #earth revolves and is turned like an ecstatic Mevlevi in perfect order within most exalted aims. How is it then, as an #atheist published, they suppose the death-tainted events of the earth, like the #earthquake,  which resembles the earth's shaking off itself the weight of certain forms of #heedlessness of which it disapproves from #mankind, and especially from the #believers, to be without purpose and the result of chance? How is it that they show the grievous losses of all those stricken to be without recompense and to have gone for nothing, and cast them into a fearsome #despair ? They are both making a great #error and perpetrating a great #wrong. Indeed, such events occur at the command of One All-#Wise and All-#Compassionate, in order to transform the transient property of the believers into the equivalent of alms, and make it permanent. And they are atonement for their sins arising from ingratitude for bounties.

At least 445 people were killed and 7,370 people were injured 🇮🇷 🇮🇷 🇮🇷 Imagine you’re fast asleep and everything around you begins to collapse. You wake up to find your self pinned to the ground, with multiple layers of rubble separating you from the freedom. You’re trapped and it’s hard to breathe. You yell for help, but you’re buried under layers of residue from the tragedy. All you can do is pray that people on the outside would miraculously dig their way through the rubble to find you. It’s only a matter of time until you suffocate and give in to meet your maker.➖➖➖ Will your prayers help that person escape? Probably not. Take action and help in a way that can make somewhat of a difference.

At least 320 people are dead after a truck bomb exploded in one of Mogadishu's busiest intersections during a traffic jam. This resulted in the collapse of a popular nearby hotel and other buildings in the area.

This is the worst terror attack in Somali history.

Another bomb detonated in the city's Medina District, killing 2 people.

The story is still developing.

Last year these days we experienced a strong earthquake here in Wellington. Although it hit north of south island, we experienced a long strong shake here in the south of north island... just before midnight. I was new in Wellington and alone. There are no words to explain how scared I was. I stayed awake till morning, listening to the radio which was saying there was tsunami alert for Wellington. It was a very bad night following with a few bad days... that night I expected any thing... nothing happened to the flat that I was living in and no one died in wellington... you know in New Zealand they tell you to stay indoors when a shake occurs simply because of this fact: building are safe here...
.

Last night, there was a strong quake in Iran and... that is Iran... building are not safe and you are told that you should not stay inside if a quake happens... you should run outside... run for your life... in Iran earthquakes kill and it is not God's rage or whatsoever! It is people's fault! It is poor management fault...
.
 Luckily my family and friends are safe, but lots of my countrymen are not... some have lost their beloved ones... some have lost their houses... and some are still under debris... please pray for them... this is the least we can do..."

If I remember correctly my dad got it for free a little over 10 years ago and it was in really good shape. All it needed was a head gasket. However, instead of fixing that cheap gasket and selling it, he gave it to my older brother and told him to tear it apart. This may seem like a tragedy and a waste, but it's kind of a beautiful tragedy. There are now plants growing in the backseat, the entire inside is covered in moss, and it's given a home to animals in the area. Life kinda works itself out.

We need to prepare them ""Physically"" as well as ""Mentally"" and ""Spiritually."" Get helmets for our little ones.  Bicycle helmets, football helmets, any kind of helmet you can get.  Keep it right by their beds as they sleep.  They NEED to know what is about to happen.  They need to know WHY this is happening, and they need to know How this is happening.  Before it happens.  Plan with them.  Have drills, have them put on their helmets, shoes, grab their flashlights and get out of the house, Fast.

Our Children MUST BE PREPARED.  What if you are not with your children when Disaster Strikes? What if there is so much destruction it takes you days, even weeks to get to them?  If we teach our children what we are learning of Disaster Preparedness, when that time comes, you will not have to worry about them.  They will know how to cook without power.  They will know how to purify water if it needs to be done.  They will know how to stay alive if we show them now.  Our Children are Gods, we are not doing them justice by learning how to prepare and not teaching them what we know.  Teach them everything you can about being prepared from first aid to cooking.  And on that day, maybe it may be you who needs first aid, they will know what to do.  Include the children in all of our planning.  Every one in our home will play a part in the ""Survival"" of our families.  Even if you have children away from home, send them information on preparing for and how to survive disaster.  We Must Prepare our Children.  We Must Prepare our Family. Whether they believe you or not. 
All of us, especially our children, need to understand that this earthquake is not the end.  It is only the beginning of sorrows.  There will be aftershocks and aftershocks, and more aftershocks.  There will be thousands of aftershocks After the original earthquake.  Some of which being as large as the original ""Major Earthquake."" The ground will shake for a long time and if we prepare our minds, prepare our children's minds for this now, we will not lose our minds as is going on in Japan.

Yes, many of the men, wome"

The spiral staircase left from a ruined building, reminds of the davastating earthquake, which not only destroyed houses but also took thousands of people's lives.

From a documentary project I shot in the village of Marpak and surroundings, in the epicenter of the 2015 Nepali earthquake.

The village was completely destroyed during the earthquake, taking many lives and leaving people homeless. Nowdays they are living in tin temporary huts, waiting for the governmental help, which doesn't seem to come.
Despite the horrible event, most of the people I've met don't loose optimism. They smile, laugh, watch TV, children go to a temporary school... life continues and that is what matters the most now."

1342,damaged_infrastructure,"#NewYork has the power to counter a record greenhouse #gas surge!

Amidst all the mind-bending news of the week #terrorattack on a #Manhattan bike path; chair of a presidential campaign indicted for “conspiracy against the =UnitedStates” — one other story stands out for its long-term importance: researchers reported that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere surged by a record amount last year.

CO2 levels rose by 3.3 parts per million in the air, 50% faster than the average over the last decade. That means a few things, none of them good.

First, the last time there was this much carbon #dioxide in the atmosphere roughly three to five million years ago  the extra heat it trapped made #Earth a very different place. Among other things, sea levels rose as much as 20 meters.

Note that #TimesSquare is about 16 meters above sea level!

Second, this rise is coming much faster than anything in previous history. We're burning coal and oil and #gas much faster than #volcanoes have ever produced #CarbonDioxide before 10 to 20 times as fast.

Third, this year’s sudden spike may be a sign that the planet’s forest and ocean systems — which slowly absorb carbon from the atmosphere — may be beginning to falter. We know that forests and grasslands are stressed by the extra heat and dryness — the cloud of carbon pouring out of Napa and Sonoma in California last month’s fires is testimony to that.

1368,damaged_infrastructure,"5 years ago this was my street where I lived... Hurricane Sandy came in with a vengeance and she changed my life forever. At 30 years old I had to start over again... I have wonderful friends and family that didn't let me do it alone. Their generosity was humbling. Sandy led me on a path to success. I am happily relocated in a wonderful area that has been good to me, I have built up a successful training career and I have made new friends for a lifetime. It wasn't easy, but for me it happened for a reason. My heart goes out to Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida...you will rebuild and you will be stronger than ever. Stuff comes and goes, we suffer from attachments. On this anniversary, let's celebrate our strength. Positive situations come from the negative. We persevere and keep moving forward! #hurricanesandy #2012 #ortleybeach #fielderave #humble #pride #friends #family #jerseystrong #sandyanniversary #5yearanniversary #onward #upward #helpeachother #loveeachother #bekind #charity #donate #helpinghands #rebuild #strongerthanever #puertorico #texas #florida"

But on a rainy Friday the 13th in April of 1928, a dangerous secret lurked in the garage on the first floor, one which threatened the lives of every happy dancer on the second floor on the building. https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/disaster-area/id1071491908?mt=2https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/disaster-area/id1071491908?mt=2 #disaster #disasters #history #historypodcast #historypodcasts #podcast #podcasts #podcasting #podcaster #podcasters #explosion #westplains #westplainsdancehallexplosion"
